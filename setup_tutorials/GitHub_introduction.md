## Updating PCDA Materials on GitHub



## GitHub Desktop

Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). Open the application and log in to your account. 

Click the '+' on the upper left to create or download (clone)  a project. Select 'pcda' and click 'Clone pcda.'

Save the project somewhere on your system.

The client will take a moment to download.

When it's done you'll see a log of past edits.

Click 'No Uncommitted Changes' at the top to see the interface you'll spend most of your time with. Since we haven't made any changes yet, everything is blank.

Navigate to your project directory and open a text file. Each page is in Markdown format, which has almost no learning curve. Here's a [quick reference](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) I like.

Any plaintext editor will do; I'm using [Typora](https://typora.io/), which displays Markdown nicely. Make an edit and save the file.

Return to GitHub Desktop and you'll see a list of files with updates. Describe your changes in the text box on the lower left, then click 'Commit to master' to save your state.

Finally, click "Sync" in the upper right to upload your changes to GitHub.

Clicking 'Sync' will also download any new/updated files from the project on GitHub. You'll want to do this before starting each work session to make sure you have the most recent files.

## parse.io

If GitHub Desktop is too much hassle (or if you need to make an edit from someone else's computer), [parse.io](https://parse.io) is a nice Web-based editor that connects to GitHub.

Once you make changes on a given file, click the save icon on the right.

Enter a description and click "Commit." This syncs the file to GitHub instantly.
