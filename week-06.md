## Week 6

### Objectives
Wget and Applied Archival Downloading

### Exercises
1. ["Applied Archival Downloading with Wget"](https://programminghistorian.org/lessons/applied-archival-downloading-with-wget) lesson in Programming Historian by Kellen Kurschinski.
*some hints!*
- Since we are using our Jupyter Notebook thru our Docker Container, you'll have tweak the assignment a little bit by doing some code editing and some environment switching: so,
  1. build the python script in your text editor (Atom, for example),
  2. save it in your `/sharedfolder` (be sure it ends in .py),
  3. navigate to the `/sharedfolder` in the terminal window.
  4. execute the python file through the command line using `python [yourfilename].py` to produce your "url.txt" file. You'll find it in the `/sharedfolder` directory.
  4. load that "url.txt" file into the Jupyter Notebook using the code provided in the lesson (your Jupyter Notebook is already situated in the `/sharedfolder` so you don't have to navigate to that directory.) If you're in Jupyter Notebook, you'll want to add an exclamation point at the beginning of this line:
  ```
  !wget -i urls.txt -r --no-parent -nd -w 2 --limit-rate=100k
  ```
- Reference the [Wget Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/wget.html) if you are curious about the code bits.
- And, if you're really stuck, [check out the  workaround](https://github.com/tanyaclement/cpcda18.github.io/blob/master/Week_06_ProgrammingHistorian_workaround.ipynb).
- There is also one thing that has changed since this tutorial was written:  
This:
"http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/search/pages/results/?state=" + value.escape('url') + "&date1=" + cells['year'].value.escape('url') + "&date2=" + cells['year'].value.escape('url') + "&dateFilterType=yearRange&sequence=1&sort=date&rows=5&format=json"
has to be (*notice the https change*):
"*https*://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/search/pages/results/?state=" + value.escape('url') + "&date1=" + cells['year'].value.escape('url') + "&date2=" + cells['year'].value.escape('url') + "&dateFilterType=yearRange&sequence=1&sort=date&rows=5&format=json"
- Finally, it *is not advised* unless you have expertise in downloading and installing packages, but if you want to do this on your machine without using Docker, there are handy instructions in the [Automated Downloading with Wget](https://programminghistorian.org/lessons/automated-downloading-with-wget) on Programming Historian by Ian Milligan

2. ["Fetching and Parsing Data from the Web with OpenRefine"](https://programminghistorian.org/lessons/fetch-and-parse-data-with-openrefine) *Example 1: Fetching and Parsing HTML and Example 2: URL Queries and Parsing JSON* in Programming Historian by Evan Peter Williamson

*hints* refer to [Week 4](https://tanyaclement.github.io/cpcda18.github.io/week-04.html) if you are having trouble opening OpenRefine.

Open Terminal in macOS and launch our Docker container:

```
docker rm -f pcda_ubuntu
docker pull pcda17/ubuntu-container
docker run --name pcda_ubuntu -ti -p 8889:8889 --volume ~/Desktop/sharedfolder/:/sharedfolder/ pcda17/ubuntu-container
```

In Windows 10, open PowerShell and enter the following to launch the Docker container:

```
docker rm -f pcda_ubuntu
docker pull pcda17/ubuntu-container
docker run --name pcda_ubuntu -ti -p 8889:8889 --volume C:\Users\***username_here***\Desktop\sharedfolder:/sharedfolder/ pcda17/ubuntu-container
```
